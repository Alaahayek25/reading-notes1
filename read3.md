History of Git
Git traces its roots to the open source software project Linux kernel. Developers of this project began using a DVCS called BitKeeper in 2002. In 2005, many of these developers stopped using this DVCS due to tension between the Linux kernel community and the company behind BitKeeper’s and the eventual revocation of the DVCS’ gratis status. Subsequently, Linus Torvalds, the chief architect of the Linux kernel, began creating Git. With the intention of creating a DVCS with a workflow design similar to that of BitKeeper, which was also fast, Git allowed for non-linear development via multiple branches, could support large projects, possessed strong mechanisms preventing corruption, and had a simple design. Since its inception in 2005, Git has become one of the most utilized Version Control Systems in the world.

Getting Started
Download Git
In order to use Git, your computer must have it available. If you already have Git on your computer, you should make sure you have the latest version.

Git can be installed in three ways:

Install as a package
Install via another installer
Download and compile the source code.
Mac OS X
Terminal

The simplest method for installing Git on a Mac (for Mavericks 10.9 and above) is running Git from the Terminal. If Git is not installed, you will see a prompt for installation.

Git Website

You can also download Git by visiting this link and following the posted directions:

http://git-scm.com/download/mac

GitHub

A third option is to install Git as part of the GitHub for Mac install. GitHub is repository hosting service, which we will discuss in a future section.

Download GitHub for Mac via the following link:

http://mac.github.com

Windows
Git Website

You can download Git by visiting this link and following the posted directions:

GitHub

Install Git as part of the GitHub for Windows install.

http://windows.github.com

Linux
Package Manager

You can try installing Git via your distribution’s inherent package management tool.

For Fedora:

$ sudo yum install git
For Ubuntu:

$ sudo apt-get install git
Git Website

To download Git for Linux, visit this link and follow the posted directions:

http://git-scm.com/download/linux

Graphical Clients
Git includes inherent Graphical User Interface (GUI) tools. However, users can also utilize third-party tools created for particular platforms.

GUI Clients

You can access a variety of GUI clients for Mac, Windows, and Linux via the following link:

Initial Customization
After making sure Git has been installed, you should perform some customization steps, which should only need to be completed once on any machine. To change settings, you can repeat these steps.

Configuration of Variables

An inherent Git tool called git config allows the setting of configuration variables that control aspects of Git’s operation and look.

Identity Setting

After installing Git, users should immediately set the user name and email address, which will be used for every Git commit.

Type the following into Terminal or Command Line:

git config --global user.name "Jane Smith"

git config --global user.email "example@email.com"
To confirm that you have the correct settings, enter the following command:

git config --global user.name (should return Jane Smith)

git config --global user.email (should return example@email.com)
*By using the –global option, these Git settings apply to anything on the system. To use different identity settings for a specific project, change the working directory to the desired local Git repository and repeat the steps above without using –global.

Default Text Editor
Without configuration of a default text editor, Git will use the system’s default editor–most likely Vim. To configure a different text editor, such as Emacs, type the following into your Terminal or Command Line:

$ git config --global core.editor emacs

Note: For some editors, you may need to find specific instructions for default configuration.

Check Settings
To check settings, use the git config --list command.

Example:

$ git config --list

user.name=Jane Smith

user.email=example@email.com

color.status=auto

color.branch=auto

color.interactive=auto

...
Getting Help
There are three ways to get more information on a particular command, by accessing the manual:

git help command

git command --help

man git-command
