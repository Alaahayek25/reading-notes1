# A great feature of any text editing software is code completion. Code
completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion
feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally
typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing
you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos.
Also, some code completion includes the closing of tags when you
open them, or the closing of brackets when you open them, or the A great feature of any text editing software is code completion. Code

## The next feature that you should look for in a text editor is a nice
series of themes. These themes will allow you to change the color of
the background of your text editor, the series of colors in your text,
and sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing
software as well. Usually, web developers use a dark background and
brightly colored text. This combination seems to be easier on the eyes
—but there are other themes to choose from as well. Since you’ll be
using your text editor most of the time, it’s good to find a theme that
might reduce eye strain and fatigue.


`Comparison `

A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text.
It also manages text, and manages files. I love that name “text
wrangler” because in a way that’s what really a text editor does. It
wrangles your text together into something meaningful.
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of
different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
You can think about an IDE very much like Microsoft Outlook. If
you’ve ever used Microsoft Outlook, you would have quickly noticed
that it was an email client, a calendar, a task manager, a to-do list all
in one software package. Similar to how an IDE is an all-in-one
software package.
While you might not be ready, or have the need to use a compiler, or
a debugger when you’re just starting out in web development, you’ll
get to see how an IDE operates in your text editing software. When
you’re ready to use an IDE, you’ll be more confident in how to use it
because you’ll already had some experience with it by using your text
editor.
